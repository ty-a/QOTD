# QOTD
A simple java-based QOTD server. 

# Running
First compile the files, then you can run it using java Server

Since the QOTD Protocol uses port 17, you will need superuser priveleges to run it.

At this time, it only uses a static QOTD specified in the QOTDProtocolHandler class in the QOTDProtocolHandler.java file.

In the future, this will change to be more useful.
